# Poultry Detection Using YOLOv5
This project demonstrates real-time object detection on poultry farm images using YOLOv5. It simulates an intelligent livestock monitoring system that can be used in smart agriculture and poultry automation.
The notebook was built in Google Colab using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect and localize chickens (birds) in a farm setting. The objective is to showcase how deep learning and computer vision can support poultry health monitoring and automation in agriculture.
## Project Highlights
- Implemented YOLOv5 object detection using PyTorch
- Processed real poultry images captured in a farm-like environment
- Visualized bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Simulated use case for smart farming and IoT-based automation
## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Google Colab
## Repository Contents
- `YOLOv5_Poultry_Detection.ipynb`: Colab notebook with complete code and step-by-step instructions
- `poultry1.jpg`: Sample poultry image used as input
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup, and documentation
## Sample Output
- The output image is generated automatically when the notebook runs YOLOv5 detection.  
- It includes bounding boxes and confidence scores on the detected poultry
## Use Cases
- Automated poultry monitoring systems
- Livestock health analysis using computer vision
